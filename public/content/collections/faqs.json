    "question": "How does the AI system work without weather APIs?",
    "answer": "Our AI uses pattern-based learning from your historical InfluxDB data combined with astronomical calculations for sun position. It learns seasonal patterns and adapts to your specific location and conditions.",
    "enabled": true
  },

    "question": "What accuracy can I expect from the predictions?",
    "answer": "Solar generation forecasting achieves 85%+ accuracy for next-day predictions, while load forecasting reaches 90%+ accuracy. The system improves over time as it learns your specific patterns.",
    "enabled": true
